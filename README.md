# dotNetRDF Server

A modern .NET implementation of RDF services.

The goal of this repository is to provide a library of building blocks which can be easily composed to create bespoke, cross-platform RDF servers in .NET as well as a simple configuration-driven implementation.

Initial implementation will focus on the web services defined by the core RDF standards:

* [SPARQL 1.1 Protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/)
* [SPARQL 1.1 Graph Store Protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-http-rdf-update/)
